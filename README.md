# Azure Cloud Security Solutions

This repository showcases a collection of cloud security solutions and engineering projects designed to demonstrate the application of best practices in securing cloud environments. It focuses on building secure infrastructures using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), network security, and other cloud security technologies.

The projects highlight the integration of cloud security with DevSecOps and automation principles, covering topics such as secure network configurations, vulnerability management, identity and access management (IAM), and continuous monitoring.

## Projects

### Network Security Setup & Automation
**Description**: This project demonstrates the implementation of secure virtual networking using Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs) in Azure. It highlights best practices for planning and implementing security within virtual networks, focusing on efficient access control and resource segmentation.

### Firewall Configuration & Monitoring Dashboard
**Description**: Deploy and configure cloud firewalls for network protection. Create a monitoring dashboard to track network traffic, blocked IPs, and other security metrics, providing real-time insights into network security.
